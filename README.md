# Recite

A spaced repetition trainer written with Angular. My goals for this project are the following:

- Learn Angular
- Learn Thai

As such, the code might not be the cleanest, but it's my first entry into Angular. Also, since another goal of mine is to learn Thai, some functionality might be more suited for training the Thai language.

# Build & Deploy

In order to build & deploy, run the following commands:

```sh
$ npm run github-build
$ npm run github-deploy
```

I have not been able to get this working in Github Actions, so far.
