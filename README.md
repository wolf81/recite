# Recite

A spaced repetition trainer written with Angular. My goals for this project are the following:

- Learn Angular
- Learn Thai

As such, the code might not be the cleanest, but it's my first entry into Angular. Also, since another goal of mine is to learn Thai, some functionality might be more suited for training the Thai language.
